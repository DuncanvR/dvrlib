DvRlib: Personal Java library
===

This extensive library contains most of the support classes I wrote during my studies.
It contains six sub packages, targeted at the following fields:

<table>
<tr><td>algorithm</td><td>Extensible bases for algorithms;</td></tr>
<tr><td>container</td><td>Generic classes that contain elements, like trees and lists;</td></tr>
<tr><td>generic</td><td>General utility classes;</td></tr>
<tr><td>graph</td><td>Abstract and concrete implementations of graphs consisting of nodes and edges;</td></tr>
<tr><td>localsearch</td><td>Extensive framework for defining problems, solutions and search neighbourhoods,
                               as well as several strategies for traversing the defined search space;</td></tr>
<tr><td>matrix</td><td>Simple representation of two-dimensional arrays for numbers;</td></tr>
</table>
